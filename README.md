           Patient Profile & Diagnosis Trends


As a Data Analyst for a mid-sized healthcare clinic. You’ve been given a synthetic dataset containing two tables: 
basic patient demographics (age, sex, race, insurance, ZIP code) and a diagnosis history containing ICD and CPT codes for each visit. 
The job is to help the clinic understand the makeup of its patient population and the most common conditions they treat. Doctors see patients one by one, but you get to see the big picture.
Use this dataset to build simple insights about who your patients are and what health issues are most common.

Questions to Answer

What does the clinic’s patient population look like by Age?

What are the top diagnoses overall?

How many visits does the average patient have, and who are the high utilizers?

Which CPT codes (procedures) are performed most often?
